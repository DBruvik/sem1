		<h1>Teach your students using the books the professionals use</h1>
		<p>
			Although our books are written for professional programmers 
			who need to master new job skills, there have alwways been 
			instructors teaching job-oriented curricula who&rsquo;ve adopted 
			our books. For example, our books are used: 
		</p>
		<img src="exercise.jpg" alt="teacher and student">
		
		<ul>
			<li>in college and university MIS programs that focus on providing 
			students with practical, real-world experience</li>
			<li>by technical institutes and community colleges that focus on the 
			skills that employers are looking for</li>
			<li>in Continuing Ed and Extension programs where the students are 
			professionals who are expanding their skills</li>
		</ul>
		<p id="last"> 
			So if your program fits one of those profiles, please take a look at 
			our books. I&rsquo;m confident you&rsquo;ll discover a new level of 
			structure, clarity, and relevance that will benefit both you and your
			students.
